Project Title:Fruit Classification using Machine Learning Algorithms
Project Description:
This project implements various machine learning algorithms to classify different types of fruits based on their physical characteristics. 
Utilizing a dataset that includes measurements of apples, oranges, lemons, and mandarins, the project aims to identify the most effective algorithm for accurate fruit classification. 
The project involves data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and comparison of different classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine.
Purpose of the Project: Fruit Classification Using Machine Learning
The primary purpose of this project is to classify different types of fruits (apples, oranges, mandarins, and lemons) based on their physical characteristics using machine learning techniques.
Dataset:
The dataset consists of measurements of different fruits, including apples, mandarins, oranges, and lemons.
Each entry contains features such as mass, width, height, and color score.
The dataset was formatted from the original collection and is available as a text file (fruit_data_with_colors.txt)
Algorithms Implemented:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
5. Gaussian Naive Bayes
6. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Key Findings:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) showed the highest accuracy in classification on the test set, achieving a test accuracy of 100% with k=5.
The Decision Tree classifier achieved high training accuracy but demonstrated signs of overfitting.
Logistic Regression performed the least effectively among the algorithms tested.
Visualization:
Box plots and histograms provided insights into the distribution of features.
Scatter plots illustrated the relationships between different features, highlighting correlations.
Summary:
In summary, the project is about exploring different machine learning techniques to achieve optimal classification performance for a specific fruit dataset, providing insights into the effectiveness of various models for this task.
The KNN algorithm proved to be the best performer for classifying fruits based on the provided dataset.
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in solving classification problems and provides a foundation for further exploration in this area.
